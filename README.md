# RuneScape-Helper
An application intended to perform multiple different tasks in order to improve the quality of life of people playing RuneScape.


the EXPCalculator class has several functions that gather and change data in order to calculate the amount of EXP points required to get to a user-specified
level.

the CombatLevelCalculator class gets data from the user and uses it to calculate the user's combat level. 

the PercentageCalculator class allows a user to input a number as a goal, and have that data stored in a file in order to check the user's progress towards that goal.

the RunescapeHelper java file is the main executable file of the application. This is where the GUI will be scripted, and where the functions from the other classes
will be called.
